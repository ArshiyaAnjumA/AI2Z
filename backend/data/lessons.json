        "explanation": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.",
        "analogy": "Think of AI like a very smart puppy. You have to train it (machine learning) for it to know what to do. It doesn't just 'know' things magically; it learns from examples you show it.",
        "key_takeaway": "AI is not magic. It's math and code that learns patterns from data."

        "title": "Machine Learning vs. Traditional Code",
        "explanation": "In traditional programming, you give the computer rules and data to get answers. In Machine Learning, you give the computer data and answers, and it learns the rules.",
        "analogy": "Traditional programming is like following a recipe exactly. Machine Learning is like tasting a dish and figuring out the recipe yourself by guessing and checking.",
        "key_takeaway": "ML figures out the rules (logic) on its own by looking at data."

        "title": "Large Language Models (LLMs)",
        "explanation": "LLMs are deep learning models trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human language. They predict the next word in a sequence based on probability.",
        "analogy": "Imagine a super-read librarian who has read every book in the world but has amnesia. If you ask them a question, they guess the most likely next word based on everything they've ever read, one word at a time.",
        "key_takeaway": "LLMs are next-token predictors, not 'thinking' beings."
